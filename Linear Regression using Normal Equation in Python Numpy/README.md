# Machine Learning using Linear Regressin in Python Numpy

The Jupyter Notebook file "Notebook.ipynb" contains the code for how to train a Linear Regression model using the Normal Equation in the Python Numpy Library. 

In the notebook an artificial dataset is created using Python Numpy Library. Then a Linear Regression model is trained on this artificially generated dataset usint the Normal Equation. Later a new test set is created and predictions are made about the test set using a weighted sum of inputs.

This Python Notebook contains code to the following blog-
