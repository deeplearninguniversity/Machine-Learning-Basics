# Machine Learning using Linear Regressin in Tensorflow

The Jupyter Notebook file "Notebook.ipynb" contains the code for how to train a Linear Regression model using the 
Normal Equation in the Tensorflow Library.

In the notebook an artificial dataset is created using Python Numpy Library. 
Then a Linear Regression model is trained on this artificially generated dataset usint the Normal Equation. 
Later a new test set is created and predictions are made about the test set using a weighted sum of inputs.

This Python Notebook contains code to the following blog-
