The Jupyter Notebook file "Notebook.ipynb" contains the code for "Building a Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch using Keras".

The notebook contains the code for building your own Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch using Keras API that internally used Tensorflow as a compute Engine. We train and test the model on MNIST dataset. 

This notebook contains the code to the following blog- https://deeplearninguniversity.com/building-a-convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-using-keras/
